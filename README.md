Grid builder for Contao 3.1.*
=============================

Contao supports a 960px grid by default. But what if those 960px don't quite fit your needs?

Here's your extension that builds your grid within the internal style sheet editor.

1. Create a new style sheet
2. Enable the grid builder
3. Enter the desired full width, number of columns and gutter width
4. Save and close
5. Have fun ;-)
